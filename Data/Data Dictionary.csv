"Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) Data Portal View (Parent Data Only)","The Division of Policy and Shortage Designation (DPSD) in the HRSA, Bureau of Health Workforce (BHW) develops shortage designation criteria and uses them to decide whether or not a geographic area or population group is a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA), Medically Underserved Area (MUA), or Medically Underserved Population (MUP). More than 34 federal programs depend on the shortage designation to determine eligibility or as a funding preference. About 20 percent of the U.S. population resides in primary medical care HPSAs. HPSAs may have shortages of primary medical care, dental, or mental health providers; may be urban or rural areas; population groups; or medical or other public facilities."
"Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P) Data Portal View (Parent Data Only)","Medically Underserved Areas (MUA) may be a whole county or a group of contiguous counties, a group of county or civil divisions or a group of urban census tracts in which residents have a shortage of personal health services. Medically Underserved Populations (MUPs) may include groups of persons who face economic, cultural or linguistic barriers to health care. The Shortage Designation Branch in the HRSA Bureau of Health Professions National Center for Health Workforce Analysis develops shortage designation criteria and uses them to decide whether or not a geographic area or population group is a Medically Underserved Area or Population."

"HPSA Name","This attribute represents the title case format, user friendly name which is generated by decoding the Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) name which came directly from the source system."
"Service Area Name","This attribute represents the name assigned to the Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P)."
"MUA/P Source Identification Number","This attribute represents the unique identification number assigned to each Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P) designated area at designation time."

"Designation Type","This attribute represents the designation type of the Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P)."
"Index of Medical Underservice Score","This attribute represents the Index of Medical Underservice (IMU) score. The lowest score (highest need) is 0; the highest score (lowest need) is 100. In order to qualify for designation, the IMU score must be less than or equal to 62.0, except for a Governor designation, which does not receive an IMU score.

Therefore, the primary state for one of these areas is the state associated with the parent or primary record. Also, the primary state is used for aggregating counts and sums at the state level."
"Status","This attribute represents the designation status of the Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P) as a text string."
"Primary State Abbreviation","This attribute represents the two alphabetic character code established by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for identifying U.S. states or U.S. territories which is associated with the location of the parent or primary entity.
